A space to be free from worries and competition and just relax.

Abstract-Pad is my first project. And I wanted it to be something meaningful. Hence I chose a meditative drawing experience which can act as a tool for emotional release rather than being something aesthetically perfect. This ia a minimal version of what I dreamt but as a first project, I am proud and satisfied. (In short, I Love it!)

# No Rules, No Pressure, No Competition - Just Draw, color and Flow
Abstract-Pad is a minimal, meditative drawing experience built for emotional release rather than perfection.
There are no rules, no pressure, and no “right” output — only movement, color, and flow.

This project is an exploration of how simple creative tools can help people slow down, breathe, and reconnect with themselves.

# ✨ Why Abstract-Pad Exists
This project is here because my goal is to create a digital space which is thriving with creativity, calming and meditative. Something which relaxes you from the pressure of the world. And what could be better by releasing it through art? And when we have minimal options, less clutter, our brain relaxes and creativity soars to its peak. And that's so Abstract-Pad.

1. You can't undo what you draw. Adds the real-life drawing touch.
2. Minimal tools - Because our goal is to relax.
3. No Pressure - You're here just to draw.

Just you, the canvas, and the moment.
It’s not about creating “good art”. It’s about being present.

# My Idea of Abstract-Pad
Abstract-Pad is not some crazy detailed drawing software out there. Because that's competitive. Its a space. A space where you can express yourself with no judgements, no pressure from society, just a pause from your regular crazy, insecure world.

Abstract-Pad encourages:
1. Intuitive expression
2. Play over perfection
3. Calm interaction
4. Flow-state drawing

The interface intentionally stays out of the way so the user can stay connected to the act of creating.

# Thoughtful Interaction Design
Abstract-Pad handles complex interaction gracefully:

- Drawing is limited strictly to the canvas
- UI elements remain fully interactive
- Sliders are protected from canvas event hijacking
- Desktop and mobile behavior remain consistent

This project required careful coordination between p5.js canvas events and DOM UI controls, especially for touch devices.

# Tech Stack

1. p5.js — creative coding & canvas rendering
2. HTML / CSS — minimal interface & responsive layout
3. Vanilla JavaScript — interaction logic
4. Font Awesome — intuitive iconography

No frameworks. No abstractions. Just core basics used thoughtfully.

# Design Principles

Minimal UI
Soft color language
Floating controls
Zero learning curve
Emotion > functionality

Every design decision was made to reduce friction and cognitive load.

# What I Learned
Canvas Element working and functions
Mouse interactions vs touch interactions
Changing Modes based on clicks
Save functionality
Preventing canvas event conflicts with DOM elements

# Future Possibilities
I dont think personally that I would want to change anything. I just love this project as it is with all its shortomings. Because every decision is a thoughtful choice here.

# Final Note
Abstract-Pad is not a game. It’s not a productivity tool. It’s a quiet digital space.

If even one person feels calmer after using it —
the project has already succeeded.
